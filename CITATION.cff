abstract: >-
  Ensuring software compliance with legal regulations is
  especially challenging for small organizations, as
  extracting legal requirements from lengthy and complex
  texts demands significant effort and expertise. While
  prior automated approaches have aimed to extract
  structural and semantic metadata from legal documents,
  they often overlook the interdependencies between metadata
  attributes and depend on manual or heuristic-based methods
  that lack generalizability to new texts. Legal meaning
  often emerges not from individual metadata elements alone,
  but from the relationships between them—such as how
  obligations, conditions, and exceptions interact across
  clauses and sub-sections. This artifact provides a
  framework for translating legal requirements into an
  executable Python code representation using GPT-4o. The
  representation preserves the structural and semantic
  metadata relationships in legal text. We envision using
  this “executable” legal translation for downstream
  analysis of compliance verification.
